## How to translate
All the strings are in the *thegorge-localize.js* file. Add your own language by duplicating an entire block from another language (English, for instance). The key for each of the language blocks defines the text that will show on that language's button. So write there the name of your language in your own language (ex: English, 繁體中文, Русский, Português, etc).

Pull requests are reviewed, merged and deployed manually, so it takes some time to review them, specially when there are conflicts with previous translations, and it's not immediately obvious which is better. 

And thanks for your help. You all are awesome!
